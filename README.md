# DSA Hash Table

This project consists of implementing my own hash table data structure from scratch.

## Get Started

I assume you already have choco installed. If not, check out [their official website](https://chocolatey.org/install).

1. If you don't have `make` istall it via an elevated command prompt.

```bash
choco install make
```

2. Then, run the main python file.

```bash
make -s run
```
